# Amnesichat
## An encrypted and anti-forensic public web chat server
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description:

Amnesic web chat offers several key benefits, particularly in enhancing user privacy and security. By not retaining conversation histories or user data, amnesic chat systems ensure that sensitive information shared during discussions remains confidential and is not accessible after the chat ends. This ephemeral nature fosters a safer environment for users to express their thoughts without fear of surveillance or data misuse.

## Warning: 

By using this service, you agree to the terms of service and acknowledge that you will not use it for illegal activities. The developer is not responsible for any misuse of the tool.
