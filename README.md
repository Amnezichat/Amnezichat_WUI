# Amnesichat
## An encrypted and anti-forensic public web chat server
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description:

Amnesic web chat offers several key benefits, particularly in enhancing user privacy and security. By not retaining conversation histories or user data, amnesic chat systems ensure that sensitive information shared during discussions remains confidential and is not accessible after the chat ends. This ephemeral nature fosters a safer environment for users to express their thoughts without fear of surveillance or data misuse.
